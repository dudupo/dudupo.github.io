    <h2>A kick into the Error Correction Code field.</h2>
    <p>
    Today is possible to finish an entirely major of computer science, mastering a wide range of disciplines,
     including abstract machines, compilation processes, and machine learning,
      without being exposed to any of the imperfections of those ideals.
       That fact didn't bother me if I wouldn't hear so many times the argument that quantum computation is impossible due to noisy behavior.
        So I decided to write a review that is, on the one hand, accessible such that every person could enjoy it while in another,
         it's enough technical to explain the whole picture and the present issues of the fields. 
    </p>
    <h3> A bit of history. </h3>
    <p>
        In the half of the last century, the vision of programable machines (computers) began to seem feasible due to some
         technological breakthroughs. Yet, one challenge still needed to resolve to enable communication.
          Handling noisy channels was a significant issue those days. Although progress has been made,
           scientists realized that decreasing the error rate  -the number of bits that flip spontaneously- to zero is
            an impossible mission. There were even people who argued that achieving digital computing is beyond humankind's
             reach.  
        But as it seems, this Html page succeeded in receiving into your computer, and those notes' goal is to review
         how it's done.
    </p>
    <h3> Basic definitions. </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Channel - a name for an environment in which one has only partial certainty over its assets,
             in the sense that the assets might absorb errors. For example, an electrical wire between pair of chip components.
        </li>
        <li> 
            Code - the ABC language, which one might use to pass a message through the channel to overcome a noisy channel.
             A good Code enables the recovery of messages that were damaged. Any string in the code is called a codeword.
              For analysis, the length of the initial message is fixed, and we will denote it by \(k\) and call it the dimension of the code.
               In addition, the length of the transmitted codeword is also fixed. Denote it by \(n\), and it is called the length of code. 
        </li>
        <li> 
            Distance - the minimum number of charter swaps (bit flips) that one needs to do for transforming one codeword
             to another. The distance also measures how hard mother nature should work to transform the original message into
              another valid message. For example, consider the 4-repetition code, in which every charter is multiplied by 4.
               That is, the word "hi" is mapped into "hhhhiiii". Therefore even if one of the "h"s will flip
                into "a" ("hahhiiii"), one still has enough information to correct the error. Similarly, we could
                 construct the 400-repetition code, which will allow us to deal with an even more significant amount of errors.
                  But it is clear that multiplication requires pay in transmitting more bits, which gets us to define the 
                  fourth parameter of the code. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Rate - the ratio of bits in the original message to the number of bits transmitted through the channel ( \( \frac{k}{n}\) ). The goal is to construct an optimal code both in distance and rate. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It will make it convenient to think over the parameter above as the code's definition,
         and we will denote a code with length \(n,\) dimension \(k,\) and distance \(d\) by \(C = [n,k,d]\).
        <div style="position: relative; width: 100%;">
            <div style="position: relative; width: 350px;" >
            We say that the code is linear if the summation of the codewords pair is also a codeword.
            In that case, the code is a linear space. The map from the original space into the code is called the generator, and by linearity, it is clear that the mapping is also linear. For example,
            the 4-repetition code over the binary strings could be represented by its generator matrix \(G\).
            Or equivalency by the generator kernel, the parity check matrix \(H\).  <br><br>              
            And for the r-repetition code we denote by \( [n=kr,k,d=r] \) the paramters of the code. 
            At first glance, it might seem that we could achieve tolerance against an arbitrary number of faults by
             increasing the envelope size. But real-world models show that each bit we add into the transmission has
              an equal chance to flip as the original bits. In other words, for a code to be applicable,
             the number of faults it should tolerate should be linear in the number of bits it sends.
             It is clear that for the repetition code to pass a message at an efficient rate, it must
              pay by terrible tolerance (and opposite).
              So the question arises: <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Are there codes in which their distance and dimension are linear at their length?

            Linear rate.
        </h3>
        We could think about the \(2r\)-repetition code as the code obtained by encoding an \(r\)-repetition codeword
        with \(r\)-repetition code (again). So we have seen a technique that generates from a given code a new code by
        applying it twice, which yields an increased distance. Can we pump the rate? <br>
        The answer is yes; suppose that we have a small code \(C_0\) at length \(w\). Then, consider the following construction:
         take a \(w\)-regular tree and put the codeword bits over the edges. The assignment will be a valid codeword if,
          for each vertex, the local word obtained by contacting the values over its adjacent local edges
           (according to fixed orientation) is a legal codeword in \(C_0\).  
   
    </div>    
    
    </p>
    <img src="../img/tree_code_bw.jpg" style="width: 800px; " alt="tree code">
    <div>
        <p>
            Note that if a single bit flip results a valid codeword in \(C\), then it implies that there exists a codeword on the
             small code  \( C_0 \) that can not absorb a single flip. Identical arguments yield that the new code's distance is at
              least the original. 
              Due to the recursive structure of the graph, the dimension of the code grows exponentially with the tree's depth.
               Therefore it is linear in the number of the edges and, hence, linear in the length of the code.
